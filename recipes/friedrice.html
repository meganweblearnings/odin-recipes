<p>Who doesn't like gyoza?
    <br>Even if it is veggie, the dipping sauce alone you could drink.<br>It just takes a long time to wrap, so you may as well
    go out and buy some.

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul{text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;}>
    For Gyoza Filling
    <li>oz extra firm tofu</li>
    <li>5 oz king oyster mushrooms (eringi)</li>
    <li>2 oz shiitake mushrooms</li>
    <li>3.5 oz red cabbage</li>
    <li>5 oz cabbage</li>
    <li>1 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt) (for dehydrating cabbage)</li>
    <li>2 oz carrot</li>
    <li>3 oz onion</li>
    <li>2 green onions/scallions (1.6 oz, 44 g)</li>
    <li>1 knob ginger</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Method:</h3>
<ol{text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;}>
    <li>Wrap the tofu with a paper towel and place it on a tray/plate. Put another tray/plate on top of the tofu and press the tofu down with a heavy object or two, for roughly 30 minutes to 1 hour (I pressed for 2 hours this time; 400 g before pressing, 355 g after pressed). If you’re in a hurry, you can alternatively microwave (without plastic wrap) for 1.5 minutes (W1000) and drain the water.</li>
    <li>Discard the tough core of cabbage leaves and cut into julienned pieces.</li>
    <li>Mince the julienned cabbage into small pieces. Depending on your gyoza wrappers, it’s easier to tuck in smaller pieces in the wrapper than chunkier pieces.</li>
    <li>Repeat the same for red cabbage. Discard the tough core of cabbage leaves and cut into julienned pieces.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, add the onion, two kinds of mushrooms, carrots, and green onions. Then add the minced garlic (I use my garlic press here).</li>
    <li>Cook uncovered until the gyoza is nice and crisp on the bottom. Transfer to a plate and serve with dipping sauce. For the dipping sauce, combine the sauce ingredients in a small plate and mix it all together.</li>
</ol>
